# Stock Market Data Ingestion and Processing Pipeline

This repository showcases a real-time stock market data processing pipeline built using AWS services and Apache Kafka. 

## Project Overview

The pipeline ingests live stock market data from a simulated application, processes it using Apache Kafka, and stores the results in an Amazon S3 bucket. AWS Glue Crawler discovers the data in S3 and creates a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Finally, Amazon Athena is used to query and analyze the data.

## Architecture

The architecture of the pipeline is as follows:

1. **Data Source:** A simulated stock market application generates real-time stock data.
2. **Data Producer:** A Python script using the Boto3 SDK acts as a Kafka producer, publishing the stock data to a Kafka topic.
3. **Kafka:** Apache Kafka acts as a message broker, distributing the stock data to consumers.
4. **Data Consumer:** A Python script subscribes to the Kafka topic and stores the received data in an Amazon S3 bucket.
5. **AWS Glue Crawler:** Crawls the S3 bucket and creates a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, making the data accessible for querying.
6. **Amazon Athena:** A query engine that allows you to query and analyze the data stored in S3 using SQL.

## Technologies Used

* **AWS Services:** S3, EC2, Kafka, Glue, Athena
* **Programming Languages:** Python

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - An AWS account
   - AWS CLI installed and configured
   - Python and necessary libraries (e.g., boto3, kafka-python)

2. **Deployment:**
   - Set up the necessary AWS resources (S3 bucket, IAM roles, etc.)
   - Deploy the Kafka cluster on EC2 instances.
   - Deploy the producer and consumer scripts.
   - Run the Glue Crawler to discover the data in S3.

3. **Usage:**
   - Run the stock market simulation application.
   - Observe the data flow through the pipeline.
   - Use Amazon Athena to query and analyze the processed data.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement data quality checks and validation.
- Add data transformation and enrichment capabilities.
- Integrate with machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Implement a more robust error handling and monitoring system.
